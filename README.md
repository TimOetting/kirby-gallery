# Gallery Field for Kirby CMS

This is a custom gallery field for [Kirby](http://getkirby.com). It lets you pick and order your image files inside the page panel

Here is a blueprint example:

    fields:
      ...
      pictures:
        label: Gallery
        type: gallery

This gives you a field like this:

![Sort Mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TimOetting/documentation-images/master/kirby-gallery/sort_mode.jpg)

By clicking the "Select images" Button you enter a select mode where you can pick the files to include to you gallery.

The content will be YAML-structured. Inside the template, the field therefore has to be decoded as an array using $page->gallery()->yaml().

## Options

### Changing the aspect ratio of the thumbnails
By default, all images are displayed in their original aspect ratio. If you would like to force a custom aspect ratio, i.e. to show the thumbnails as squares, you can pass the option ``aspectRatio``to with the format ``width:height`` your field in the blueprint:

    fields:
      ...
      pictures:
        label: Gallery
        type: gallery
        aspectRatio: 1:1

You can hide the filename under the thumbnail by adding the option ``displayFilename: false``to the blueprint:

    fields:
      ...
      pictures:
        label: Gallery
        type: gallery
        displayFilename: false
